# Space Decentral - Future Forward
[ðŸ’¬ Chat on Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#spacedecentral-missions:matrix.org)

Developing a living, iteratively updated strategic plan for how all of our missions interconnect with one another.

## Space Mission Ideation
We are inviting community participants to propose new space missions of interest so they can be considered in an upcoming voting round, where we collectively decide the top priority projects to focus our efforts. 

New projects can be proposed either as an individual and/or as self-organized teams. After ideas have been gathered, we will hold a vote and select one project to activate for each of the three categories:

### Category 1 - Robotic

Near-term mission with potential for immediate commercial applications. Relatively low cost, making use of current available technology or easily achievable innovation.

Example: Explore the halo orbit around L2 where the future Deep Space Gateway would be and broadcast a signal to show both the Earth and the Moon at the same time.

### Category 2 - Human Spaceflight

Mid-term mission to improve current technologies or facilities that support manned missions in space.

Example: A sample return facility on the Deep Space Gateway.

### Category 3â€Šâ€”â€ŠExpansion

Forward looking mission with innovative ideas that pave the way for human settlements outside of Earth.

Example: A city on the moon.


## Proposal Development
NOTE: WE WILL PROVIDE AN UPDATE TO THESE REQUIREMENTS SOON

Your proposal should include the following details. Remember that the community will vote on the projects, so make sure your proposal is clear and objective!
* **Project Name:** Do you have a cool name for the project?
* **Project Tagline:** Describe the project in one sentence.
* **Goals:** What is the proposal aiming to achieve?
* **Justification:** Why is this an important idea that Space Decentral is uniquely positioned to develop? 
> Some sample questions to answer: Who else is working on this idea? Why is Space Decentral in a special position to develop the project? Are there any world cues/data that points to this being a viable idea? Is this an idea that has been ignored by the industry and why is now the right time?
* **Deliverables:** As a result of this project becoming active, what deliverables do you propose become co-developed with the community over a duration of 3 months?
> e.g. a fully fledged project plan, engineering designs, software code
* **Commercialization:** Provide a preliminary commercialization strategy that addresses key technical, market and business factors pertinent to the successful development of the proposed project.
* **Risks:** Discuss potential barriers to entry, potential competitors, and risks.
* **Team:** Who are the team members, what are their backgrounds, and what is each personâ€™s availability?
* **Project Manager:** Does anyone on your team plan on being the project manager and leading this project with the community?
Leaders are expected to help define tasks and develop momentum for the project.
  * If yes, how many years of project management experience do they have?
  * If yes, approximately how many hours a week can they contribute?
* **Video Presentation:** Include a link to a 5-10 minute video presentation that is discussing the proposal.
* **Proposal File:** (optional) Add a link or upload a detailed plan (PDF, word doc, google doc) if you have one.

## Pull Request Sample For Submitting a Project

To submit an idea, follow these steps:
* Fork the Future Forward GitHub repository
* Create a new directory with your projectâ€™s name inside the proposals/ folder.
* Inside that, either add a file for your project's proposal or create a README.md file that includes the full proposal
* Create a Pull Request to merge your submission into the Future Forward repository. In that Pull Request, be sure to fill in all of the relevant info described above.
* Share your project in our chat to engage the community and discuss it's viability.

We will provide you more details and instructions at the end of April for how to submit a pull request in Github, and also the expected format of the pull request.
