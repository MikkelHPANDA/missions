# Space Decentral - Future Forward
[ðŸ’¬ Chat on Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#spacedecentral-futureforward:matrix.org)

Developing a living, iteratively updated strategic plan for how all of our missions interconnect with one another.

## Project Harvest: Season 1
We are inviting community participants to propose new space missions of interest so they can be considered in an upcoming voting round where we as a community decide the most top priority projects to focus our efforts. New projects can be proposed either as an individual and/or as self-organized teams. After ideas have been gathered, we will hold a vote and select one project to activate for each of the two categories:
* Cat 1
* Cat 2


## Pull Request Sample For Submitting a Project
```
