# Space Decentral - Future Forward
[ðŸ’¬ Chat on Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#spacedecentral-futureforward:matrix.org)

Developing a living, iteratively updated strategic plan for how all of our missions interconnect with one another.

## Project Harvest: Season 1
We are inviting community participants to propose new space missions of interest so they can be considered in an upcoming voting round, where we collectively decide the top priority projects to focus our efforts. 

New projects can be proposed either as an individual and/or as self-organized teams. After ideas have been gathered, we will hold a vote and select one project to activate for each of the two categories:
* Cat 1
* Cat 2


## Pull Request Sample For Submitting a Project

To submit an idea, follow these steps:
* Fork the Future Forward GitHub repository
* Create a new directory with your projectâ€™s name inside the proposals/ folder.
* Inside that, either add a file for your project's proposal or create a README.md file that includes the full proposal
* Create a Pull Request to merge your submission into the Future Forward repository. In that Pull Request, be sure to fill in all the relevant info (see below for sample)
* Share your project in our chat to engage the community and discuss it's viability.
